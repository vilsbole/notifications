You will be provided with a backend with a search endpoint that handles the server part.
⚠️ There is a bug in the search code that you will have to fix 😏

The current frontend is very minimal and you will be in charge to:

- develop a nice UI/UX experience. Mockups in this document just give a rough indications of what are the features of the application. Feel free to implement any layout you find pretty and that offers the best UX experience
- create any components you would need and feel free to restructure the files architecture
- ⚠️ we intentionnally put some bugs/problems in the code, happy debugging 🥳
- add code quality tools (linting, formating)
- 🎁 **bonus** github action that runs those tools
- 🎁 **bonus** anything cool you have in mind

## Getting started

- fork and clone this repository
- complete the homework
- do as many commits as you want
- push your work on you fork
- The deliverable will be your fork URL 🚀

We hope you will enjoy the challenge 💪
